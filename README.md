# URI schemes

The scheme identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource on the Internet. Scheme being the identifier that URLs use to express what type of protocol the specific resource should be served over. In short, schemes are simply identifiers for protocols.

For example
In the link https://example.com, https is the scheme that tells the browser (or whoever the requester of that resource is) that the resource at example.com will be served over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS), which is the type of "protocol".
